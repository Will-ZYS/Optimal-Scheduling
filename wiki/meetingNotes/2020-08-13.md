**Attended members:**   
Lucas Gao, Tommy Shi, Will Zhang, Martin Tiangco, Jiawei Ge, Ziwei Yang

**Content:**
- Tommy gives the team a rundown of the input reader implementation 
- Will gives the team a rundown of the algorithm implementation 
- Merge all code into master
- Decide to use merge instead of squash merge to keep tract of everyone's commits in master
- Things to do next:
    - Tidy up the documentation in wiki
    - Test the code to ensure the correct solution is given
    - Implement the output writer class 

**Next meeting time:**  
If there is any bug found in the code, the team will organise a meeting on Friday (14/08/2020).

### **Team meeting #4**

**Date:** 13/08/2020  
**Location:** Zoom  
**Time:** 9:16 pm –12:30 pm   
**Attended members:**   
Lucas Gao, Will Zhang, Martin Tiangco

**Content:**
- Fixed the bug where NullPointerException is thrown because of empty lastProcessor variable when comparing the lastProcessor and currentProcessor ids
- Fixed the bug where the deep copy of the processor isn’t creating a new HashMap<TaskNode, Integer> tasks object
- The algorithm() method no longer has a check condition -> this is already checked in the createNodes() function instead
- We now need to test the algorithm against different graph inputs to verify if the answer given is correct. For the few test inputs we tested, they gave the correct optimal solution.
    - Test input is the graph given from the lecture
        - Test 1 = uses only 1 Processor
        - Test 2 = uses 2 Processor
        - Test 3 = uses 3 Processor

**Next meeting time:**  
TBD
