### **Team meeting #8**

**Date:** 25/08/2020
**Location:** Zoom
**Time:** 5:00 pm â€“ 6:00 pm
**Attended members:**
Tommy Shi, Martin Tiangco, Jiawei Ge

**Content:**
- Discuss optimisation methods
- Identified two problems:
    - With more than one empty processor, we are allocating Task A to all of them, increasing the number of states we have to explore. 
    - Our algorithm is not keeping track of identical tasks. We explore additional states as we explore state_a where Processor 1 has identical tasks A and B and state_b where Processor 1 has B and A (in this order). Since A and B are identical, we only need to explore one of the states. 
- We implemented a solution to Problem 1.

**Next meeting time:**
TBA.
